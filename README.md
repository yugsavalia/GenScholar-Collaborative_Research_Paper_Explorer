# GenScholar-Collaborative_Research_Paper_Explorer

The process of collaborative academic research often involves a fragmented workflow.
Researchers typically use separate applications for reading papers, taking notes, and
discussing findings, leading to disconnected feedback and inefficient knowledge
sharing.<br>

Gen-scholar is a proposed web platform designed to solve this problem by transforming
research papers into interactive, shared workspaces. The platform will allow research
teams to upload documents, generate AI-powered summaries, annotate text in
real-time, and hold discussions directly within the context of the paper.
